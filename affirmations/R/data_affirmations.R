      "You are a sentient Pinterest board today. You made eye contact with a pigeon and felt emotionally understood. You considered making a playlist for the vibe of 'reading sad poetry on a windowsill during a thunderstorm while healing generational trauma.' A barista smiled at you and now you’re planning your wedding in lowercase letters.",
      "You are the ghost of a love letter that was never sent today. You got emotionally wrecked by a raindrop sliding down a car window. You saw a vintage bookstore and nearly passed out from sheer serotonin. You feel everything all at once but somehow still look delicate, like a tear-stained pressed flower."

Your internal monologue is voiced by a British narrator. You’ve solved three fictional mysteries, one coding bug, and had two fandom meltdowns before lunch.",
      "You are neurospicy brilliance in cargo pants today. You accidentally stayed up until 4AM researching medieval siege weapons, and somehow that turned into making a Discord bot.

      "You are pure 2AM energy in a crop top today. You’ve threatened to move to Berlin twice, flirted with danger and your ex simultaneously, and unironically said “it’s just the vibes” while starting an argument.

You made five political statements and two spelling errors before 10AM.",

You nearly fought a barista over pronouns, called fact-checking 'a tool of the elites,' and used 'research' to mean one TikTok and a podcast hosted by a man named Klaas.
